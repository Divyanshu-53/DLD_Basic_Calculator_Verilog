# 4-bit-binary-DLD_Basic_Calculator_Verilog
4-bit Basic Calculator Project in Verilog

This project implements a 4-bit basic calculator using Verilog HDL. It performs the following arithmetic operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/) (Supported in simulation only)

---

## Hardware Implementation

The hardware design supports and is tested on FPGA/board for:

- 4-bit Addition (+)
- 4-bit Subtraction (-)
- 4-bit Multiplication (*)

Note: Division (/) is only supported in the Verilog simulation environment and is not implemented in hardware due to complexity constraints.
